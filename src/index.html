        Here you can load scripts. Generally speaking, it's better to have a
        single script and use import statements from within that script, so they
        all can get bundled into a single file.

        Putting it last like this means the rest of the page will start loading
        before the script starts loading, which is a good idea if (like many
        webapps) you have a huge bundle of js to deliver.

        You must including a closing </script> tag, self-closing tags are
        disallowed. This is for historical reasons, you can google to find out
        why :p
